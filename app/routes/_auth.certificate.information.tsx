          What is an SSL Certificate?

          When browsing the internet, you may have noticed a padlock (
          <LockIcon boxSize="3" marginBottom="1" />) symbol next to the website's URL. This padlock
          indicates whether the website has a valid SSL/TLS certificate or not. These certificates
          are used to secure websites, encrypting and decrypting data exchanged between clients and
          servers.
        </Text>
        <Text marginY={4}>
          An SSL/TLS Certificate is like a digital lock that keeps information exchanged between
          your computer and a website private and secure. It helps protect your private or sensitive
          information (e.g., credit card numbers, login credentials, etc.) from being intercepted by
          hackers or cybercriminals.
        </Text>
        <Text marginY={4}>
          Unfortunately, there are malicious websites that do not provide any security and cannot
          prove their identity to your web browser. To ensure your safety while browsing the
          internet, modern browsers automatically block access to such sites that could harm your
          computer. For example, opening an HTTP URL with an expired or misconfigured certificate
          will result in a warning, as illustrated&nbsp;
          <Link href="https://expired-rsa-dv.ssl.com" target="_blank">

          </Link>
          .
        </Text>
        <Text marginY={4}>
          When a website has an SSL certificate, you'll see a padlock icon and the web address
          changes from "http" to "https" in your browser's address bar. This means that the
          connection between your computer and the website is encrypted and secure.
        </Text>
        <Text marginY={4}>
          SSL certificates are essential for websites that collect sensitive information from users,
          like online stores, banks, or any site that requires you to enter personal information.
          They help build trust between websites and their users and ensure that your data is kept
          private and secure.

                A set of certificates that are used to verify the authenticity of an SSL/TLS
                certificate. They serve as a bridge between the SSL/TLS certificate and the root
